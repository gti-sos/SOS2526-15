- **Project description**: "Our project analyzes the correlation between a country's happiness index and its population density and minimum wage. We study how wages and the possibility of encountering other people, which we measure using density, can affect a nation's happiness. The goal is to understand how happiness varies based on socioeconomic factors and, thanks to this data, nations can establish strategies to improve the happiness of their inhabitants."
